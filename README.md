# React Context

Context provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level.It solves the problem of props drilling.The React context provides data to components no matter how deep they are in the components tree.

In this project I'm using Context API together with React Hooks to build a fully functional CRUD app that emulates list of employees.It will read employee data, create new employees, update employee data, and delete employees. I'm using hard-coded objects which will serve as the state.
